# Memory-Allocation-With-Buddies-in-C
Completed for CS313 class (Intro to Computer Systems). This program allocates a piece of memory from the computer from which a user can then request memory to be allocated inside of the allocated piece of memory. The Ackerman function makes random calls to My_Malloc(allocates memory on the piece of memory that was allocated at initialization) and My_free(frees memory that was allocated by My_malloc)
